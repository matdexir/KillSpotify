# Kill Spotify😵

## WHY🤔?
On my Ubuntu 18.04 laptop, I realized that there is no timer option for closing Spotify after a certain amount of time. Therefore, I decided to create a python script that will do it for me.
The process is quite simple👍. I find the current process ID of Spotify. Then I kill it after a certain amount of time has passed.
## HOW DOES IT WORK🤖? 
Just run 
```bash
    python main.py
```
Then you will get prompted for a countdown. Enter it then you are set.💫

## SOME REQUIREMENTS🔧
None. subprocess and sys should already be on your machine.

## FUTURE GOALS 🥅
- [x] Make a barebone version of it.
- [x] Better error handling.
- [ ] Add GUI.
- [ ] Get it integrated into Spotify?.

## NEW FEATURES
- Timer(mins and secs for now😭)
